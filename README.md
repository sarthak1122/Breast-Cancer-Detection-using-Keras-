The above project includes various modules of keras that are need to improve the computational speed and accuracy of the model.
Keras can be used for various CNN Projects as a very important tool in developing new Projects.
It also encorporates Tf which has been build by Google.


You can know more about Keras and Tf in the link Provided below.
