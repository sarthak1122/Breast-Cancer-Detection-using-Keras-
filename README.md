# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Keras

Hi Everyone,

The Following is a code snippet that is used to detect Breast Cancer in an indivisual using Models of Keras upto a accuracy of 95%.

The above projcet includes various modules of keras that are need to improve the computational speed and accuracy of the model.
Keras can be used for various CNN Projects as a very important tool in developing new Projects.

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google, often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

TensoFlow comptations are expressed as stateful dataflow graphs. The name TensorFlow derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays. These arrays are referred to as "tensors". In June 2016, Dean stated that 1,500 repositories on GiHub mentioned TensorFlow, of which only 5 were from Google.

TensorFlow is cross-platform. It runs on nearly everything: GPUs and CPUs—including mobile and embedded platforms—and even tensor processing units (TPUs), which are specialized hardware to do tensor math on.
